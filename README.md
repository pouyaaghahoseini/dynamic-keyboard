# Dynamic Keyboard

Dynamic Keyboard is an interactive keyboard where, upon pressing a key, the subsequent keys with a higher chance of occurrence increase in size. This dynamic resizing aims to enhance typing speed and reduce errors. Our goal for designing the Dynamic Keyboard is to compare the Dynamic Keyboard with the Normal keyboard, which shares the same appearance; the only distinction lies in their interactivity.

## Overview

The Dynamic Keyboard is an android keyboard designed as part of a course project study. It offers two keyboard modes: Dynamic and Normal. Users are prompted to type a predefined set of words, and their typing speed and accuracy are recorded for analysis. The primary objective behind designing the Dynamic Keyboard was to enhance typing speed and minimize error rates by dynamically enlarging keys that are more likely to be pressed. This keyboard design was developed as the final project for the Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing course.
A comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dynamic Keyboard. Multiple participants engaged in testing both keyboard modes in a counterbalanced manner. Completion time and error rates were meticulously measured and subsequently analyzed.
